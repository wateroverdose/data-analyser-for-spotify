# spotify-data-analyser
transform your Spotify data archive into a nice html doc!

this tool is in early development.

## idea:

- get data from Spotify
- put data into tool
- tool processes data 100% locally
- tool outputs html doc

## usage:

- request data from Spotify
- unzip the data and copy the MyData directory into ./secret or specify the path later
- run the script: `node ./src (specify path here if you don't want to copy the directory)`
